# _inmm
Eu2 engine localisation dll. The name _inmm.dll was simply inherent from old patches. 

Just evacuated from old repos. The project in this state was built using VS2012. May need some modification to build in newer VS.

The output dll should support vanilla HOI2 and AOD 105 or DH 104(?) when the game exe is properly modified. No idea how mush work is needed to make it work with newer versions.
